AI Horror Story Generator Project Brief
Project Overview
The AI Horror Story Generator is a full-stack application that automatically creates horror videos by combining AI-generated narration, images, and audio. The system fetches horror stories from Reddit, enhances them for audio narration, converts them to professional-quality voiceovers, generates thematic images, and combines everything into a cinematic horror video.
Target Audience

Horror content creators
Podcast producers
YouTube/TikTok channel owners
Digital storytellers
Horror enthusiasts

User Flow

Initialization

User launches the application
System begins the automated pipeline


Story Selection & Enhancement

System fetches horror stories from Reddit (r/nosleep, r/shortscarystories, etc.)
AI evaluates and selects the most promising story based on narrative strength
Selected story is enhanced to podcast-style format with improved pacing and atmospheric elements


Audio Generation

System converts the enhanced story into a professional voice-over script
AI voice generation creates realistic narration using specialized horror voice settings
Audio is processed with appropriate pacing and tonal qualities


Visual Content Creation

System generates subtitles from the audio narration
Story is segmented into scenes
Each scene is converted into descriptive prompts for image generation
Stable Diffusion generates thematic horror images for each scene


Video Assembly

System aligns generated images with corresponding audio segments
Transitions, subtle zoom effects, and timing are applied
Subtitles are added and positioned appropriately
Optional background music is integrated at appropriate volume levels


Output & Delivery

Final video is rendered in 1080p HD format
All assets (video, audio, images, subtitles) are saved to Google Drive
System provides links to all generated content
