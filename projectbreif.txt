Project Brief: Automated Horror Story Narration & Video Generation App

Overview

This project aims to create a UI-based application that automates the process of generating horror story narrations and cinematic videos. The application fetches horror stories from Reddit, enhances them, generates a voice-over, creates subtitles, generates cinematic images, and compiles everything into a final video with ambient effects.

Key Features

1. Story Fetching and Enhancement

Fetch horror stories from selected subreddits (e.g., r/nosleep, r/creepypasta, etc.).

Use AI to filter and enhance the selected story for better narration.

Include an introduction and conclusion tailored for horror podcast narration.

2. Voice-Over Generation

Convert the enhanced story into a voice-over script.

Allow users to select narration speed and voice options.

Use a neural TTS model to generate high-quality narration.

Save the voice-over as a high-quality WAV file.

3. Subtitle Generation

Transcribe generated audio into subtitles using the Whisper model.

Generate an SRT file with precise timestamps.

4. Cinematic Scene Description Generation

Analyze subtitle segments to generate scene descriptions.

Ensure descriptions focus on visual storytelling and atmosphere.

5. Image Generation

Generate AI-powered cinematic images for different story scenes.

Use Stable Diffusion XL to create high-quality visuals.

Apply predefined horror-centric styles (cinematic, realistic, artistic).

Ensure consistent aspect ratio for video compilation.

6. Ambient Sound Design

Analyze scene descriptions to determine the best ambient sounds.

Mix background horror sound effects dynamically based on the scene.

Ensure seamless blending of ambient sounds with the narration.

7. Cinematic Video Compilation

Compile generated images, narration, and subtitles into a cinematic horror video.

Apply subtle animation effects like zoom-in, camera shakes, and panning.

Add transitions and cinematic black bars for a professional look.

Apply user-selected video quality settings.

Export final video as an MP4 file.
